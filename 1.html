  Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</a> is the standard markup language for <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong> and web applications.<br>
  It is one of the most basic building blocks of every website,
  so it's crucial to learn if you want to have a career in web development.<br>

    HTML determines the structure of web pages.<br>
    This structure alone is not enough to make a web page look good and interactive.<br>So you'll use assisted technologies such as CSS and JavaScript
    to make your HTML beautiful and add interactivity, respectively.<br>
    You can also look at HTML, CSS, and JavaScript this way:
    HTML is the structure of a house, CSS is the interior and exterior decor,
    and JavaScript is the electricity, water system, and many other functional
    features that make the house livable.
